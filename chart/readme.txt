As the owner of the developer license for the included amCharts, I am happy to include these  in HerbIgniter.  As far as I know, there is no issue with its inclusion.  If there is, you may need to remove it from your distributions if you derive HerbIgniter into your own project.

If you the like the charts, or need maps, stock charts and other programmable flash widgets, visit http://amcharts.com/
