# Introduction #

In the standard known as Model-View-Controller (MVC), things are organized for the desktop or mainframe, but not efficiently for web design. MVC is a great way way of thinking, but the web is not the same kind of application. We have adapted CodeIgniter to function under a new model, with special attention paid to GUI automation. This has lead way to HerbIgniter and its Topical Objective Display (TOD) object declaration concept.

You can't do it all in Flash. To create rich web applications (RIA), you need to pick a place to stand in a jungle of tools. The classier web developer peers out from a RoR or PHP environment, because the complete power of computing is available from that groundwork. The problem is, there are a dozen other tools necessary to complete user experience. How can one library provide a feature-rich developer environment, without being too open ended or missing key features?

HerbIgniter is here to accomplish that by providing a streamlined model, a supportive graphical interface libraries to handle commonly needed components, and a succinct range of features to provide maximum configurability combined with ease of use.
